## Autonomous Car using TensorFlow in Udacity Simulator

This project leverages TensorFlow and OpenCV to develop an autonomous car capable of navigating a simulated environment. The car processes road images captured by the simulator, identifies the optimal path, and autonomously drives within the Udacity simulator. This repository contains the necessary scripts to train the model, process images, and drive the car autonomously.

#Project Structure
  behavior.py: Script for training the model using TensorFlow.
  drive.py: Script to drive the car autonomously in the Udacity simulator using the trained model.
  image.py: Script for image processing using OpenCV.
  
#Udacity Simulator
The Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator provides an environment to test and validate the autonomous driving model. The simulator generates road images and driving telemetry which can be used for training and testing the model.
